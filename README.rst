rdopkg tar-changes
==================

This is a tool that works in a similar way to ``rdopkg patch``. It uses
rdopkg_'s APIs to tar up all the changes in the Git -patches branch into a
"-changes.tar.gz" tarball and adds the tarball to the RPM packaging.

I use this to combine all our downstream changes into a single file suitable
for dist-git.

Comparing ``rdopkg patch`` with this ``tar-changes`` script:

Understanding branches
======================

We build RH Ceph Storage in ``ceph-*`` Git branches.
**dist-git branches** follow the form ``<product-name>-<product-version>-<OS>-<OS version>``.

For RH Ceph Storage 5, we support both RHEL 8 and RHEL 9, so we have the following branches:

* ``ceph-5.0-rhel-8``: The first release of the RHCEPH 5 product. We did not support RHEL 9 yet because it was so early.
* ``ceph-5.1-rhel-8`` and ``ceph-5.1-rhel-9``: The second release of the RHCEPH 5 product. We started building Ceph for RHEL 9.
* ``ceph-5.2-rhel-8`` and ``ceph-5.2-rhel-9``: The third release of the RHCEPH 5 product. 

For patch management, we use  rdopkg_ **-style "`-patches`" branches** 
that follow a similar convention. Note, we do not have separate "rhel-8" or "rhel-9" -patches branches, 
because the code should be identical on both OSes.

RH Ceph Storage 5:

* ``ceph-5.0-rhel-patches``: RHCEPH 5.0 downstream code.
* ``ceph-5.1-rhel-patches``: RHCEPH 5.1 downstream code.
* ``ceph-5.2-rhel-patches``: RHCEPH 5.2 downstream code.
* ``ceph-5.3-rhel-patches``: RHCEPH 5.3 downstream code.
